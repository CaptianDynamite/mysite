    <p>
      Probability is the mathematical description of random experiments,
      defined in terms of sets and functions.
    </p>

    <h3>Events</h3>
    <p>
      A random experiment or trial is an experiment whose outcome is not known
      in advance.
    </p>

    <h3>Sample Space</h3>
    <p>The set \(\Omega\) of all possible outcomes is called the sample space.
       Outcomes are sometimes referred to as sample points.
    </p>

    <h3>Events</h3>
    <p>
      An event is any set of outcomes (any subset of \(\Omega\).
      Events are usually denoted by uppercase letters, e.g. \(A\) or \(B\).
    </p>

    <p>
      A concrete example of the above is the following. The sample space for
      tossing a die is given by the following,
      \[ \Omega = \big\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \big\} \]
      Like wise, the event of rolling an even number is given by
      \[ A = \big\{ 2, 4, 6 \big\} \]
