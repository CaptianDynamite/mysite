    <header><h1>Probability</h1></header>
    <main>
      <h2>Humble beginnings</h2>
      <p>
        Probability is the mathematical description of random experiments,
        defined in terms of sets and functions.
      </p>

      <h3>Random Experiment</h3>
      <p>
        A random experiment or trial is an experiment whose outcome is not known
        in advance.
      </p>

      <h3>Sample Space</h3>
      <p>The set \(\Omega\) of all possible outcomes is called the sample space.
         Outcomes are sometimes referred to as sample points.
      </p>

      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>
        An event is any set of outcomes (any subset of \(\Omega\).
        Events are usually denoted by uppercase letters, e.g. \(A\) or \(B\).
      </p>

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        A concrete example of the above is the following. The sample space for
        tossing a die is given by the following,
        \[ \Omega = \big\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \big\} \]
        Like wise, the event of rolling an even number is given by
        \[ A = \big\{ 2, 4, 6 \big\} \]
      </p>

      <h3>Combining Events</h3>
      <p>
        Let \(A\) and \(B\) be two events.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event that \(A\) <strong>or</strong> \(B\) occurs is represented by
        \[ A \cup B \]
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, the event that \(A\) <strong>and</strong> \(B\) occur is
        represented by
        \[ A \cap B \]
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, if \( \big\{ A_i \big\}_{i=1}^n \) is a collection of events,
        then
        \[ \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \]
        is the event that \(\exists i\) such that \(A_i\) occurs,
        whereas
        \[\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \]
        is the event that \( \forall i \), \(A_i\) occurs.
      </p>

      <h3>Complement of an Event</h3>
      <p>
        If \(A\) is an event, then \(A^C\) (said as "A complement") is the event
        in which \(A\) does not occur, formally,
        \[ A^C = \Omega \setminus A \]
      </p>

      <h3>De Morgan's Law</h3>
      <p> Let \( \big\{ A_i \big\}_{i=1}^n \) be a set of events. </p>
      <p>
        Then the following holds:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> \[ \left( \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n A_i \right)^C = \bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n A_i^C \] </li>
        <li> \[ \left( \bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n A_i \right)^C = \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n A_i^C \] </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Subsets</h3>
      <p>
        Given \(A \subset B\), if \( A \) occurs, then \(B\) occurs, that is
        \[A \implies B\]
      </p>

      <h3>Impossible event</h3>
      <p>
        The empty set \(\emptyset\) is called the impossible event because it
        never occurs.
      </p>
      <h3>Certain Event</h3>
      <p>
        The set \(\Omega\) is called the certain event since it is guaranteed to
        occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        These two events have the following relationship
        \[ \Omega^C = \emptyset \qquad \mathcal{\&} \qquad \emptyset^C = \Omega \]
      </p>

      <h3>Disjoint Events</h3>
      <p>
        The events \(A\) and \(B\) are said to be disjoint if
        \[ A \cap B = \emptyset \]
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, the set of events \( A = \big\{ A_i \big\}_{i=1}^n \) are said to
        be disjoint if:
        \[ \forall A_i \in A, \quad \forall A_j \in A, \quad A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset  \]
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, these events <strong>cannot</strong> occur simultaneously.
      </p>

      <h3>Exhaustive Events</h3>
      <p>
        The set of events \{A = \big\{ A_i \big\}_{i=1}^n \} is said to be
        exhaustive if \[ \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n A_i = \Omega \]
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, at least one of these events <strong>must</strong> occur.
      </p>

      <h3>Partition</h3>
      <p>
        A collection of events \( \mathcal{P} = \big\{ A_1, A_2, \cdots \big\} \)
        is called a partition of \( \Omega \) if it is both mutually exclusive
        and exhaustive.
      </p>

      <h2>Probability, an Introduction</h2>
      <h3>A justification of \(\mathbb{P}\)</h3>
      <p>
        In order to measure the relative likelihood of events, we define a
        function \( \mathbb{P} \) in such a way that, for any event \( A \),
        \( \mathbb{P} \) can be interpreted as "the probability of A".
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose that we perform our random experiment \(N\) times, and let
        \(A\) be some arbitrary event. Let \(N(A)\) be the number of times that
        \(A\) occurs. Then, as \(N\) "becomes large", we should expect the ratio
        \( \frac{N(A)}{N} \) to "settle down" to some constant value, namely
        \( \mathbb{P}(A) \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since \(\Omega\) always occurs, that is, \(N(\Omega) = N\) we should set
        \( \mathbb{P}(\Omega) = 1 \). Similarly, since \(\emptyset\) never
        occurs we shoudl set \(\mathbb{P}(\emptyset) = 0\). Now, let \(A\) be an
        arbitrary event. Since \( 0 \leqslant N(A) \leqslant N \), we should
        have that \(0 \leqslant \mathbb{P}(A) \leqslant 1 \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Since \( N(A^C) = N - N(A) \), we should have that
        \( \mathbb{P}(A^C) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(A) \).
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, if \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint events then
        \( N(A\cup B) = N(A) + N(B) \) and so
        \( \mathbb{P}(A\cup B) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B)\)
      </p>
      <p>
        Most properties of \(\mathbb{P}\) can be found in this manner.
      </p>

      <h3>The Probability Axioms</h3>
      <p>
        The function \( \mathbb{P}: \Omega \to [0, 1] \) is called a probability
        measure if it satisfies the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> \[ \forall A \in \Omega, \quad \mathbb{P}(A) \geqslant 0 \] </li>
        <li> \[ \mathbb{P}(\Omega) = 1 \] </li>
        <li>
          If \(A_1, A_2, \dots \) are mutually exclusive events, then
          \[\mathbb{P}(A_1, A_2, \dots) = \mathbb{P}(A_1) + \mathbb{P}(A_2) + \cdots \]
        </li>
      </ol>
